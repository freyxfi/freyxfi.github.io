# Story Time

I’m not a big fan of stories, but let’s hear this one out. I know it can be boring to read through texts, but we have to, lol. So, I've been in this field for a long time, and one thing I realized is that I didn’t have a consistent routine—no streak of doing something every day, no matter what. One day, my friend British told me about this challenge. It's popular, and I've seen people, including him, posting about it. The funny part? He didn’t finish it. Now, here I am, writing this with a blank piece of paper in front of me—but not for long, as we’re going to fill it with ideas. Also, I lost my X/Twitter account, so I got a new one instead.

# Why This?

Good question! The answer is simple: this challenge will keep me doing something every day. I used to do a lot of MMA, but I took a break. This year, I have to make an impact—not on others, but on myself. So, we’ll build that aura—100,000+—just kidding, I already have that aura. No need for any fake auralizer or whatever.

# Topics

There aren’t any strict topics; it depends on how deep I need to go into one or a particular vulnerability. But here are some you’ll see me covering:

- OWASP Top 10
- Web Application Attacks
- Programming: Python, C/C++, Rust, Go, Bash (all hacking script languages)
- Automation tricks
- Recon—wait, yeah, deep recon (Reconnaissance)
- HTB machine solving
- Password Attacks
- Antivirus Evasion
- Writing and working with exploits
- Privilege Escalation (Linux/Windows)
- Active Directory (at last)

# Ok, but What Are We Gaining Here?

It’s the 21st century, and people always ask, “What do we get in return?” For me, it’s knowledge. I know how deep I go when I touch on these topics. So, whatever I learn or do, I’ll apply it to the real world. I’ll make videos about all this and share my experiences with the community. I’m really, really excited. I might not have the brainpower to do AI/ML hacking right now, but maybe in the future—or we can dive into hardware too.

# What's the Starting Point?

We’ll start with web security. I love this, it’s easy, and I’ll also do some cool HTB on the side, along with a little bit of asset hacking that I’m learning. I’m also connecting with developers and trying to think like them, which is good practice to understand how they make mistakes and how they do all that cool stuff.

# Not a New Start

As I mentioned, I have quite a bit of experience—spending around 13 hours a day on my laptop. But I’ve seen people (my friends) working even harder than me, which is so cool and amazing. Trust me, I can do that too. To make an impact—because everything depends on impact—I’m doing this. We’ll start with all the web bugs, from XSS to RCE.

# My Motive

I don’t want to die as some random nerd who used to hack and did nothing significant.

### Please connect with me! Invite me into your space, have a chat, and let’s do cool things together.

# Final Thoughts

Alright, that’s a lot. In the end, I’ll share my journey here on my blog (with different articles every day), so keep in touch. Also, follow my new Twitter account: [twitter.com/xss2rcs](https://twitter.com/xss2rcs). But heads up—I won’t follow back, lol.

Special thanks to 0xfxiii(Ben), Lukas, Sameer Husain, Pinchu, Rakesh, Anso (The girl I love) for forcing me to do this haha
