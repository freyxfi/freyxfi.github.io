**Note:** I am still working on myself. Now, there is no love left in my life. She is gone, and no one will ever come near me again. So, it's me and me again. I got my homies, and what else? I am becoming the person I used to make fun of.

# Catching Up with HTB Season 7

Alright, so HTB Season 7 is still going on. I am still keeping it up just for fun—wait, no. I am keeping it up because of the gift at the end. I am able to solve the boxes as I have already done a lot of boxes in the past. The old account is long gone, which was my OG. I have been doing this since high school, but sometimes I spend so much time on the machines that I lose touch with reality.

# I Made Another YouTube Video, Lol. That Was So Funny.

So, I was testing myself with that mystery box, and then I ended up solving it and making a video about it. So cool, right? Check out my YouTube channel for that. The name is **freyxfi** if you haven't already.

# Ruby Rank Achieved on HTB Season 7

Achieved the Ruby rank in Season 7. This is like déjà vu—I have been here like three times.

# 50 Machines Done

So, we have done 50 boxes on HTB. That's a good number, but let's make it 100.

# OS Command Injection

The Web Security Academy is good, but sometimes I think what I am learning is not what I see in the real world, which makes it even cooler. In command injection, the basics are clear: you have to make an OS-level command in the parameter, which executes. But most of the time, if that were the case, recon is very necessary. For example, what machine is it—Windows or Linux? And what command can you execute? Please check my Telegram channels for notes.

# Path Traversal

`../../../../../../../../wow`

Basically, path traversal is one of my favorite bugs, and there are many ways to bypass it. I know almost 7, I suppose. The sad part is that I do not look for it often, but we will sit on this someday and crawl through it.

# Another Cool Duplicate of Another Cool Bug

Ah, what a life! The P1 got duplicated too, but as I said, I got numb. No kidding, I do not feel anything. I do not hunt a lot as this requires a lot of time and proper preparation. You can't just hunt like a moron on any target. First, you must understand it—what is the business model, etc.

# Job Work Should Be Private

Oh, this is so private, but I can give a hint: I am digging into some medical services, lmao.

# Wireless Hacking Coming Soon

I think I will be shifting to wireless and hardware soon. I have a list and a mind map ready. Then, I will go for it.

# Learning Russian and Spanish Side by Side

I am learning Russian and Spanish together. Is that a good idea? I think I am doing it because I do not have something to flex anymore. I lost all that, and now I have started being more and more myself. I still have anger issues, so if someone fights with me, I am so scared I might kill them. I am not doing meditation, but I am praying now.

# C Programming is God

I quit C programming when I encountered pointers, lol. For real, in college, I was good at C, but then I accepted my fate after solving some LeetCode problems and doing all scripting in Python. I think now I just barely remember the C syntax.

# Watching Hunter x Hunter

Well, at least I am still watching some anime.

# For Next Week

I don't know what I will do next week, but one thing is sure: I will give it my all, as there is no one now!

Thank you for reading, everyone. Love you all.
