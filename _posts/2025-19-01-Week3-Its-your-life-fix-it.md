# OSINT CTF

So, I was assigned to make an interesting challenge. I thought, why not use the dark web and make it happen? That’s how the research started. I made use of the RaidForums arrest event, researched it, and created a medium-level OSINT-based CTF.

I then hosted it on Seaside. Thanks to my team for giving me this chance! I got very good feedback from those who played, and I’ll make a write-up on YouTube when I have time.

# zseano's Methodology  

First, thanks to Sean for sharing his methodology for free with everyone. I heard he’ll write version 2, but this one is awesome! To be honest, this was on my reading list for a year, but I never pushed myself to read it. Now, I’m really eager to try it out!  

BTW, here’s the link to it—it’s free and open:

# Started API Security  

I’m really interested in breaking APIs now, as most of the work I do somehow relates to APIs. I know basic attacks and situations, but to master it, I need to dive deeper and develop the right mindset. I have one book and some other resources to cover this week.  

# Books  

Most of the time, I’ll focus on reading the books I’ve selected. One of my goals this year is to read 10 hacking books. I’ve made a private GitHub repository to track all the books I’m reading. It’ll go public once I’m halfway done!  

The reason I read books is that I don’t like asking for help. I know how competitive this field is, and nobody has time. Even I don’t have free time—so how can I expect someone else to?  

# MMA / UFC / Restart?  

Yes, I’m still on NoFap and will stay that way for the entire year. I have that control over my mind!  

I’ve been training a lot lately. My spinning kick and round-back punch are perfect now! To advance my grappling game, I’m practicing with way higher divisions—so cool, right?  

Today was UFC 311, and I feel great knowing Islam is still pound-for-pound rank 1.  

# Busy?  

Yes, I’m very busy. I DO NOT HAVE TIME for myself. My schedule is packed from the start of the day to the end. There’s this “next version” of me, which honestly terrifies me.  

Right now, I have no free time, but I’ll fix it! Hardcoded plans don’t seem to work, so I’ll break things down into smaller, manageable steps.  

# Next Week?  

I’ve connected with some amazing people who share the same goals as me, and I’m really impressed. :) I’m happy to see how well we can grow together.  

For next week, I’ll put in all the work!
