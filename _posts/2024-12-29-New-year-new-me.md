# Weekly Recap!

This blog might not be about web security or any other security-related topic. As you can see from the tag, it's about life.

Yesterday, I felt overwhelmingly sad way sad. It hit me suddenly while I was training. Out of nowhere, as I stopped for a break, this feeling struck me so hard that I froze midway. I don’t even know how or why it happened. For a moment, I thought it might be an anxiety attack or something, considering how lonely I feel sometimes. But nah, it can’t be that; I’ve grown up this way.

Lately, I feel numb, maybe because of all the MMA training or maybe because I’m seeing the world from a different perspective now. Even though I often feel alone, I keep telling myself that maybe, just maybe, there are lots of people at the top waiting for me. I want to meet them! This whole thing feels like a race. If we stop running, no one will care. If we drop out, slip, or fall, everyone else will just keep going.

## Things I Did This Week

1. Played another HTB machine. I forgot the name, but it started with "link." It was an easy one but very close to real-world scenarios.  
2. Had an awesome time with my office team at an adventure park. We did lots of activities there. Since I’ve lost touch with most of my college friends, the people I interact with now are mostly colleagues and a few friends I made on Twitter.  
3. Broke my wrist during training. This might be an issue for my upcoming belt test next week, but I’ll see how it goes. It’s a minor fracture, and since the belt test is 80% ground game, I think I’ll manage.  
4. Got deep into Active Directory! I’ve passed the enumeration phase and started working on attacks. I compiled a list of Active Directory attack techniques in Obsidian. Let me share it:

### Active Directory Attacks  
- **Reconnaissance**  
- **Credential Theft**  
- **Privilege Escalation**  
- **Lateral Movement**  
- **Persistence Techniques**  
- **Domain Controller Compromise**  
- **Trust Exploitation**  
- **Delegation Abuse**  
- **Denial of Service**  
- **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)**  
- **Post Exploitation**  

I’ve spent a lot of time enumerating with LDAP, RPC, SMB, and Kerberoasting. The real magic happens with BloodHound. Honestly, I never liked BloodHound—it felt overcomplicated with all its graphs and mapping. But when I realized the complexity of cross-forest environments, I knew I had to use it. Seeing people on Twitter buzzing about it finally convinced me to give it a serious shot.

I don’t want this post to get too technical, though. As I mentioned, this is about life today.

### Questions on My Mind

- What is life, according to you?  
- With the world’s population so vast, how do you know you’ll make it?  
- How can one truly be kind?  
- How do you ignore stupid people?  
- Time is running out, and there’s so much to do. How do you handle this?  
- Are you smart enough? Are you where you want to be?  
- If you fought me, would you be able to kill me? (I’m not a psychopath; just curious!)  
- Why do some celebrities treat people like insects?

I saw a tweet recently about a 15-year-old bug hunter laughing at a 21-year-old for making less money. Is money everything? Early success can make you unstable and arrogant. I’ve started seeing things from other people’s perspectives. I interact with people from different countries, traditions, and cultures to understand them better. My goal? Make friends worldwide and maybe go on a world tour in 2026!

People are amazing. We can achieve anything with time and dedication. I truly believe anyone I talk to is capable of incredible things. Change can happen in a fraction of a second, and when it does, it’s transformative.
