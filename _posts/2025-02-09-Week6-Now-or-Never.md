# Done with the Project!  
The exam our company conducted at the end of January is now submitted along with the report. It was a hell of a task, and I’m glad it’s finally done! As I mentioned earlier, the web machine wasn’t that difficult, but the Linux privilege escalation was a nightmare. However, we still managed to get root access. The report was a team effort, and even though I got injured, I still managed to get it done.

# I Got Injured – Hell Nooo  
Silly mistakes and stupid moves always end up in injuries! I was doing some bad exercises, followed by freestyle moves, and ended up hurting myself. At that moment, I didn’t realize it, but once my body got into rest mode, it felt like my right hand was gone! There’s still pain, but I can bear with it. :)

# CVE Leading  
I hope to lead the CVE reproduction and finding section in my company.  

**Why am I doing it?**  
When I started, they assigned me five CVEs, and I pulled them off in just two weeks. It was easy since public exploits and documentation were available. But now, I hope to start finding my own CVEs. I’ll share more soon!  

I know very few people read all this, but I prefer to have only quality people around me.

# 100 Days on Duolingo  
Wow! Talk about being consistent with language learning. I’m learning Russian and Spanish, both for personal reasons.  

It's obvious that I want to travel. However, I don't think I can make it this year because I feel there's still a lot I need to accomplish before going into "wild mode."

# Bugs GG  
Well, I actually found 4 bugs during pentesting:  

- OTP bypass without rate limit (2FA)  
- `.git` exposed  
- Open redirection  
- Business logic error  
- I'm currently trying to exploit a file upload vulnerability, but no luck yet

I want to write a lot about them, but check my Twitter—I’ve shared everything there.

# Reports Reading  
I was reading a report on Xvideos, and boom—I closed the tab! The report was something I didn’t expect people to get a bounty for, but apparently, bypassing HackerOne’s security measures gives an edge to internal teams.  

What I **feel** is that triage teams or whoever receives your report don’t care about you personally—it all comes down to **how you present it and its severity**.

---

# Started the BSCP  
I’ve started my BSCP journey! One of my friends has already done it, so I **also** decided to take it on as a test.  

To complete it, I need to go through all the labs and then take the exam. So far, I’ve completed the **authentication** lab, and now I’m working on **broken access control**. The plan is to tackle **server-side** issues first before moving on to **client-side** ones.

# Doing HackTheBox!  
Today is **February 9**, and I still have a long list to complete. I need a **better plan** to prepare myself. There are so many cool challenges and machines I want to finish before my subscription expires.  

If I can’t complete them in time, I’ll purchase a new subscription! But funnily enough, I’ve never bought anything online before—my account got blocked, so maybe it’s finally time to fix that.

# 100 Days Challenge to Change My Life  
Sounds weird, right? But yeah, I’m doing it!  

To **cut out distractions**, I will **reduce unnecessary activities** and avoid wasting time. This challenge is going to be tough—both mentally and physically.  

I want to reach the next level, so I won’t be posting anything for weeks. Instead, I’ll just write a blog on Twitter when the time is right. No drama, just **pure focus**.  

### This challenge includes:  
> - Learning **3-4 hours daily**  
> - Testing my skills for **4 hours daily**  
> - Reading reports  
> - Meditation  
> - MMA training  
> - Pushing my limits  
> - Staying **serious but happy**—smile through the grind  
> - Writing **handwritten notes** (I have a notebook, and I will complete it!)

### Anger Issues & The Bigger Picture  
People close to me **know** about my anger issues. In the real world, it’s something I struggle with a lot, and I **want to get rid of it**.  

That’s why I’m doing this challenge—along with the **money factor**, which I **can’t** ignore. So, **discipline and consistency** are key!  

And lol, if you think I work too much—nah, I also relax. Right now, I’m watching **Hajime no Ippo**—a **must-watch anime**!

### That’s it for the week—see you in the next one!
